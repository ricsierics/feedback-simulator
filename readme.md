Feedback Simulator (playground) made from AngularJs

To run, just host it in your local IIS
No need to run npm install, node module dependency (ui.bootstrap) is already included
Uses CDN for Bootstrap, AngularJs and NgAnimate module needed for ui.bootstrap
Note: Plainly opening the feedback.html by browser will cause error, need to host in IIS. This is because AngularJs disable CORS when rendering html files
