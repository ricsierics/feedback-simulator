Feedback Simulator (playground) made from AngularJs

1. To run, just host it in your local IIS
2. No need to run npm install, node module dependency (ui.bootstrap) is already included
3. Uses CDN for Bootstrap, AngularJs and NgAnimate module needed for ui.bootstrap

Note: Plainly opening the feedback.html by browser will cause error, need to host in IIS. This is because AngularJs disable CORS when rendering html files
